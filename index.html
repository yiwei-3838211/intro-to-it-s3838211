        <h1>Interest in IT </h1>

        <p>I am interest in web programming now, after I study java programming, database, security, I also interest in AI and networking, I will take course in those fields. My project idea also may concern AI technique. To be honest, first time I interest in IT is in year 10, we should think about what should we learn in university, compare with science, arts, commerce and so on, I just prefer IT because it sounds like more logical and a sense of modern. And also I also feel IT is the trade of the future, For example, cryptocurrencies are not only involved in IT but also in financial worlds. There are also new energy vehicles that need to be used in the system of human-computer interaction is also impacting the traditional automotive industry.

        To be honest, at first I chose RMIT only because of its awesome location and the amazing appearance of many of its buildings, but after learning about it, RMIT has good local recognition and employment rates in Australia.
            
        During my studies at RMIT, I first hope to determine my future career direction, whether it is software engineering or Internet and mobile Internet or computer hardware industry. Then I will specialize in the industry of my choice.</p>
